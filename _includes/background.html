      I obtained my BSc degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and my MSc degree (with a focus on Signal Processing) at the University of Brescia, Italy, where I was born and raised 🇮🇹

      After my Master Degree, I worked in a multidisciplinary group between Glasgow, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 and my hometown to develop AI pipelines for Brain MRI segmentation.

      Currently, I am a research scholar at the <a href="aim.hms.harvard.edu">Harvard's AIM Program</a> 🇺🇸 and a Ph.D. Student at Maastricht University 🇳🇱

      My research focuses on AI applied to clinical and medical imaging data (such as CT, MRI, and X-Ray), especially in the fields of radiology, radiation oncology and cardiology. During my Ph.D., I developed a profound interest in open source, open science and reproducible research. This interest eventually led me and a few colleagues sharing the open source values to the development of <a href="https://mhub.ai">MHub.ai</a> - a platform that aims to revolutionize the dissemination of AI models in medical imaging by providing meticulously curated, optimized, and portable AI-based imaging pipelines, empowering researchers with reproducible science and cutting-edge advancements in the field.

      In keeping with this theme, I am also part of the <a href="https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons">NCI's Imaging Data Commons</a> team, where I work on integrating AI-based medical image analysis pipelines into the platform and harnessing the power of the cloud for reproducible research.
